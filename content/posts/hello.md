# Welcome

My name is Ramon Guzman and this is where I am going to be placing a polished version of my career statement.

## Experience

I will be expanding on what experiences I have and find to be relevant.


### Education

I will be expanding on my education here.

#### Skills

I will be elaborating on skills that I have. They do not necessarily need to be related to my career.

(i.e. tools I can use, hobbies, miscellaneous items I find to be relevant)


# Notes for adjusting the theme
The theme includes:

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout

So, there you have it... enjoy!
