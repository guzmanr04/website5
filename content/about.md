# Welcome
I have previously worked worked on very diverse projects ranging from virtual games to more complicated endeavors like establishing an online database. I have worked on projects on on my own and in both mid and large sized groups. Through these experiences I have had opportunities to develop interpersonal skills and my own abilities with every adversity that had risen. With this in mind I am looking to apply the skills that I have developed so far into databases and wrangling data so that I can continue to grow with those around me.
