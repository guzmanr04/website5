# Welcome
I have previously worked worked on very diverse projects ranging from virtual games to more complicated endeavors like establishing an online database. I have worked on projects on on my own and in both mid and large sized groups. Through these experiences I have had opportunities to develop interpersonal skills and my own abilities with every adversity that had risen. With this in mind I am looking to apply the skills that I have developed so far into databases and wrangling data so that I can continue to grow with those around me.

## Experience

I will be expanding on what experiences I have and find to be relevant.


### Education

Cesar Chavez High School
2018 Graduate

Allegheny College
2022 Graduate

#### Skills

I will be elaborating on skills that I have. They do not necessarily need to be related to my career.

(i.e. tools I can use, hobbies, miscellaneous items I find to be relevant)


# Notes for adjusting the theme
The theme includes:

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout

So, there you have it... enjoy!
